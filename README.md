# Matsuridayo/v2ray-core

This is a fork of v2ray-core that is designed to meet Matsuridayo's needs.

Although Matsuridayo/v2ray-core is an open source project, it is not intended for general use, as v2ray-core is. We don't recommend that third parties depend upon it. Doing so is likely to be frustrating because there are no guarantees of API or ABI stability.

Currently Matsuridayo/v2ray-core is the v2ray library in Matsuri and Nekoray.
